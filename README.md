- Hi, I’m @pluto-ld, or Pluto!
- I like web development things, and have been working with HTML and CSS for several years.
- Currently, I'm trying to learn Javascript and Bootstrap, as well as a bunch of other programming languages (though that's not the focus of this profile).
- If you're a Lioden coder and looking to learn something, I can help with a lot of basics! I'm also down to do some collaborative CSS skins for Lioden profiles from time to time.
- You can reach me on Lioden from my links section! If you're not someone from Lioden and want to talk to me about other things, email me here: plutonexcommissions@gmail.com.
